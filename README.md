In the Pacman game, I added randomAgent (randomly searches the level and checks if it can finish the game),
dummyAgent (only goes to the left) and reflexAgent (checks if there is food around, if not it randomly chooses a side) and tested the possibility of finishing the game automatically. 
In this way, I tried to understand and learn the AI's search algorithms
